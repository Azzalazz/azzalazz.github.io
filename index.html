    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in data-driven systems,
      applied analytics, and building technology that connects real-world signals to
      meaningful insights. I approach my work with an emphasis on clean, well-structured
      code, clear documentation, and maintainable system design.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic and project experience spans software engineering, data analytics,
      IoT systems, and algorithm design, with a focus on translating complex technical
      problems into practical, scalable solutions. I’ve worked on projects ranging from
      cloud-connected IoT safety and energy systems to adaptive algorithms that leverage
      implicit user signals, as well as business-focused analytics for high-traffic
      digital platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through these experiences, I’ve developed a strong foundation in Python, SQL,
      cloud technologies, and system-level thinking, while maintaining attention to
      usability, reliability, and real-world constraints. I value writing clean,
      readable code and designing systems that are both efficient and intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m particularly interested in applying data science and analytics to
      human-centered technology, digital platforms, and intelligent systems, where
      technical rigor meets real impact. I’m currently preparing for graduate study
      in Data Science or Computer Science to deepen my skills in statistical modeling,
      machine learning, and large-scale data systems while continuing to build applied,
      end-to-end solutions.
